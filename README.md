# Spicy & Better
A light Vanilla+ modpack to spice up the vanilla experience, without radically changing it.  
Originally I wanted to call it **Spiced up Vanilla**, but due to CurseForge naming politics that prevented me from using **Vanilla** in the name, I opted for **Spiced up Cream**.  
After some days I decided to change it again in **Spicy & Better** because the previous name was meh.

## The idea
I always thought Minecraft Vanilla was too boring and somehow lacking in certain aspects.  
This is my attempt of creating a version of Minecraft that fills those gaps, without changing too much the gameplay.  
For this reason, most mods here included are QoL or add small tweaks to the world.  
There are also some new biomes, mobs and foods.  
The hope is to create an overall new feeling to the Minecraft world, without radically changing it (and hopefully keep up with new versions).

## Tips
### Tips refer to an older version, changes will arrive soon!
- When creating a Nether portal, be sure to place 4 crying obsidian blocks in a 15 block radius to prevent the Nether to corrupt the Overworld!
- Keep the sounds on!
- Don't worry about collecting all the sapling and planting them, new trees will grow automatically if you leave them on the ground!
- Build paths and roads where you go, they will speed you up!
- If you need to build large structures, there are now wands to help you out!
- Need food? Almost any passive/friendly mob can drop its meat now!
- Right click on a fully grown crop to harvest it without eradicating it from the ground!

## TODOs
- Add YUNG's Better Strongholds, YUNG's Better Mineshafts, Just Enough Piglin Bartering, Better Than Mending, Path Under Gates when (and if) available for 1.18.2
- Add animations to Eating Animation for all extra foods
- Configure Drink it! to include all extra drinks
- Vertical Slabs
- Rename Tinted Connecting Glass to Tinted Glass (including localization)
- Add a backport of 1.19 when it will be officialy released
- Port to 1.19 when it will be officialy released and the mods included will port

## Known problems
- Wolf armors are not visibile once equipped if [Better Wolves] is enabled.
- Horses wearing the Copper Horse Armor don't render correctly (for this reason such armor is removed from crafting and JEI).
- [Fresh Animations] causes some rendering problems when some mobs collide on death or move while wearing armors.
