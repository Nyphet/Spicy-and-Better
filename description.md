# Spiced up Cream
A light Vanilla+ modpack to spice up the vanilla experience, without radically changing it.  
Originally I wanted to call it **Spiced up Vanilla**, but due to CurseForge naming politics that prevented me from using **Vanilla** in the name, I opted for **Spiced up Cream**.

## The idea
I always thought Minecraft Vanilla was too boring and somehow lacking in certain aspects.  
This is my attempt of creating a version of Minecraft that fills those gaps, without changing too much the gameplay.  
For this reason, most mods here included are QoL or add small tweaks to the world.  
There are also some new biomes, mobs and foods.  
The hope is to create an overall new feeling to the Minecraft world, without radically changing it (and hopefully keep up with new versions).

## Tips
- When creating a Nether portal, be sure to place 4 crying obsidian blocks in a 15 block radius to prevent the Nether to corrupt the Overworld!
- Keep the sounds on!
- Don't worry about collecting all the sapling and planting them, new trees will grow automatically if you leave them on the ground!
- Build paths and roads where you go, they will speed you up!
- If you need to build large structures, there are now wands to help you out!
- Need food? Almost any passive/friendly mob can drop its meat now!
- Right click on a fully grown crop to harvest it without eradicating it from the ground!
